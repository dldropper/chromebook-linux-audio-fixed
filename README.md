<h1 align="center">Python script to enable audio support on Chrome devices</h1>

<h4 align="center">Note: A full install of a supported Linux distro is required! Live USB sessions will not work.</h4>

# Instructions
1.     git clone https://github.com/dldropper/chromebook-linux-audio-fixed
2.     cd chromebook-linux-audio-fixed
3.     ./setup-audio

# Requirements
1. `python 3.10`
2. `git`

# Supported Devices
See the [Chrultrabook docs](https://docs.chrultrabook.com/docs/firmware/supported-devices.html) for more info.

# Officially Supported Distros
1. Alpine Linux edge
2. Arch Linux
3. Debian Testing
4. Fedora 41
5. OpenSUSE Tumbleweed
6. Ubuntu 24.10
7. Void Linux

# Other Distros
Other distros will likely work but will require you to manually install packages. The script will print a list of any packages you may need to install. It is required to have a relatively modern distro (no old LTS releases) as those will be missing important fixes.
